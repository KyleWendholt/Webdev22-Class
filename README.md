# Webdev22-Class
This Repo is a copy of class work

My computer science experience has mostly been coding in java, which I have been doing since junior year of high school. This was continued into college, with all of the core computer science classes teaching their material in java. This year I am being exposed to more, with having to learn javascript for this class, and having to learn python for another one. One project that I am working on for my Software Engineering class is creating a cloud based web application that will be used by the university to schedule classes. This project will probably relate heavily to the work that I will be doing in this class.

I can see myself using knowlege from this class in the work environment, and am going to be using this material to create the project in my Software Engineering class. I am unsure what exactly I will be pursuing after leaving university, whethere I will be pursuing a Masters degree or going straight into the job market. I hope that this is the year that I will be able to really use in the real world, not just a class room.
